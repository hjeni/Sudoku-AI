# Sudoku solver

This is a semestral project from BI-ZUM (Artificial Intelligence course) on FIT CTU. 

The project compares regular Hill climbing algorithm to the Beta Hill Climbing algorithm, both used for a Sudoku solution optimization. 
While Hill climbing is a simple optimization algorithm without any exploration, therefore has strong tendency to converge to wrong, sub-optimal slution. On the other hand, Beta Hill Climbing is a technique which introduces exploration (more popular version of exploratory local search algorithms are such as Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search). Two approaches to the Beta Hill climbing are implemented.
